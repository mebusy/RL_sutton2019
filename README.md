Recommend :

- covering Chapter 1 for a brief overview.
- Chapter 2 through Section 2.4, Chapter 3, and then selecting sections from the remaining chapters according to time and interests.
- Chapter 6 is the most important for the subject and for the rest of the book.
- artificial intelligence or planning :  Chapter 8
- machine learning or neural networks :  Chapter 9, 10


marked as `*` :  more difficult and not essential to the rest of the book.  These can be omitted on 1st reading. 


# Part I: Tabular Solution Methods

- solving simple RL problem 
- solving MDP 
    - dynamic programming
    - Monte Carlo methods,
    - temporal-difference learning 
- combining those 3 methods to solve MDP
